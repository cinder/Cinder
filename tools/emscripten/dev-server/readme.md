wasm-server
====

This is just a simple static server that happens to be able to serve and process WebAssembly files correctly.
It's not intended to be run or used in anything, just storing files here as a backup. 

If you'd like to run it instead of the default python server (or whatever other server) 
* make sure you have Node JS installed, at least version 8+
* run `npm` or `yarn` : `npm -g install wasm-server`
* you should be able to run the command `wasm-server` By default it opens on port 3000 but you can change the port number by 
adding the number to the end of the command
