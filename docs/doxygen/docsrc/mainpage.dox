\section welcome Welcome
If you are just getting started, we recommend you begin with the \ref helloCinder "Hello, Cinder" guide. If you'd like to just get a sense of what's in Cinder, take a look at the <a href="namespaces.html">Namespace list</a>. And don't forget, the samples are still the best way to learn Cinder for now as we work to fill out the documentation.
