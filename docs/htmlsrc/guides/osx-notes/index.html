		<h1>OS X Notes</h1>
		<p>These are some general notes on Cinder's implementation on OS X.</p>
		
		<section>
			<h2>Targeting</h2>
			<p>By default Cinder on OS X targets 10.8 and later. This is governed by the <strong>OS X Deployment Target</strong> build setting in both Cinder itself and the application (which must be matched). Advanced users can use this variable to enable 10.7 support, but this is not officially supported.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Development Requirements</h2>
			<p>Cinder requires Xcode version 5.1.1 or later, which in turn requires OS X 10.8 or later.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Additional Notes</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Cinder relies on the libc++ library as governed by the <strong>C++ Standard Library</strong> build setting.</li>
				<li>OS X prior to 10.8.3 does not support texture swizzling.</li>
				<li>OS X 10.9 introduced OpenGL 4.1 support for relatively recent hardware. Please refer to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/opengl/capabilities/index.html">Apple's OpenGL Capabilities Table</a> for specifics. This functionality is exposed by Cinder automatically.</li>
			</ul>
