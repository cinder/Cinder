		<h1>OS X Setup</h1>
		<p>This short guide will walk you through getting Cinder running on your OS X machine. You'll need XCode 5.1.1 or later. In general this is best installed through the App Store, and is <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12">available here</a>.</p>

		<p>If you are using one of our <a href="http://libcinder.org/download/">packaged releases</a>, you already have everything you need. If you're working from github you'll want to follow the build instructions in our <a href="../git/index.html">Cinder + Git</a> guide.</p>

		<p>To test your installation, we'll build one of the samples. From the Finder, navigate to the <em>samples/_opengl/CubeMapping</em> folder and open <em>xcode/CubeMapping.xcodeproj</em> by double-clicking it. From the <strong>Product</strong> menu select the <strong>Run</strong> item. Xcode will take a few seconds to build the sample and then it should launch and look similar to the screenshot below.</p>

		<h2>Creating New Projects</h2>
		<p><a href="../tinderbox/index.html">TinderBox</a> is Cinder's GUI tool for creating new projects quickly and easily. A guide to creating projects using TinderBox is <a href="../tinderbox/index.html">available here</a>.</p>

		<h2>Debug Symbols</h2>
		<p>While not strictly necessary, if you're working from a prepackaged release and would like to be able to step into Cinder's own code during your debug process, you'll want to build Cinder with debug symbols. This is straightforward - just open <em>xcode/cinder.xcodeproj</em> in XCode and build the Debug configuration for the Cinder target. If you are doing iOS development you'll want to do the same thing for the <em>cinder_iphone</em> and <em>cinder_iphone_sim</em> targets.</p>
				
		<h2>Cinder + Git</h2>
		<p>If you would like to keep up with the latest Cinder development, the project is <a href="http://github.com/cinder">hosted on github</a>. A guide for setting up Cinder using git is <a href="../git/index.html">available here</a>.</p>
