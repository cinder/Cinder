		<h1>Cinder + Git</h1>

		<p>If you're interested in keeping up with the latest Cinder development you'll want to setup a clone of Cinder's git repository. Cinder's home on GitHub is at <a href="https://github.com/cinder/Cinder">https://github.com/cinder/Cinder</a>.</p>
		
		<p>In general Cinder's active development is done in the <em>master</em> branch. The <em>release_*</em> branch (for example, <em>release_v0.9.0</em>) is designed to reflect minor updates to the latest official release.</p>

			<h2>Installing Git on OS X</h2>
			<p>If you don't already have Git installed on your Mac, start by downloading the <a href="http://git-scm.com/download/mac" target="_blank">Git installer here</a>.</p>

			<p>Run the installer with the default settings and then launch Terminal. Navigate to the directory where you'd like to create the repository and run this command:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">
git clone --recursive git://github.com/cinder/Cinder.git cinder_master
</code></pre>
			

			<p>If you aren't familiar with git, the only command you need to remember is <code>git pull</code> which, when executed from your new cinder_master directory, will update your copy of Cinder. Doing forget to rebuild Cinder (described below) whenever you do this.</p>

			<h2>Installing Git on Windows</h2>
			<p>If you don't already have Git installed on your PC, start by downloading the <a href="https://git-scm.com/download/win" target="_blank">Git installer here</a>.</p>
		
			<p>When prompted by the installer, we recommend that you select the <em>Use Git from the Windows Command Prompt</em> option for <em>Adjusting your PATH environment</em>. For line-ending configurations, we also recommend the default, <em>Checkout windows-style, commit Unix-style</em>. Once you've got Git installed, launch the <em>Git Bash</em> application. Navigate to the directory where you would like to setup Cinder, and execute the command:</p>
		
<pre><code class="language-bash">
git clone --recursive git://github.com/cinder/Cinder.git cinder_master
</code></pre>

			<h2>Building on OS X</h2>
			<p>The most straightforward way to build both the Debug and Release configurations of the OS X, iOS and iOS Simulator targets is to run the script located at <em>cinder/proj/xcode/fullbuild.sh</em></p>
		
<pre><code class="language-bash">
cd proj/xcode
./fullbuild.sh
</code></pre>
			
			<img class="center rounded shadow" width="500" src="images/mac_build.png" />
			
		</section>
		

		<section>
			<h2>Building on Windows</h2>	
			<p>To build Cinder on Windows, first make sure you've got the rest of your development environment setup as described in the <a href="../windows-setup/index.html">Windows Setup</a> document. Next, open up the Visual Studio solution in <em>cinder\vc2013\cinder.sln</em>. You'll build as you would any Visual C++ project, and don't forget to build both Debug and Release.</p>
		
			<p>After your build completes, the files <em>cinder-v120.lib</em> (for Release) and <em>cinder-v120_d.lib</em> (for Debug) will be created at the path <em>cinder\lib</em>.</p>

		<section>
			<h2>OpenCV</h2>
			<p>Cinder's support for OpenCV is maintained separately from the primary distribution due to its size. To setup OpenCV support, cd to your <em>blocks</em> directory and execute the command below:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">
cd blocks
git clone git://github.com/cinder/Cinder-OpenCV.git
</code></pre>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Generating Documentation</h2>
			<p>As a final step, if you'd like to have a local copy of the Cinder documentation, you can generate it using Doxygen. Follow <a href="../docs/building_docs.html">this guide</a> to learn more about generating documentaion.</p>
