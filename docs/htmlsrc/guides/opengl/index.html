<h1>OpenGL in Cinder</h1>
<a id="introduction"><h2>Introduction</h2></a>
<p>OpenGL is an open standard for graphics programming with a particular emphasis on hardware acceleration through GPUs. The standard is maintained by the <a href="https://www.khronos.org/">Khronos Group</a>. Cinder supports desktop OpenGL on Microsoft Windows and OS X, and the OpenGL ES API on iOS and Android. Additionally, Cinder supports OpenGL ES emulated via DirectX through <a href="https://code.google.com/p/angleproject/">ANGLE</a> on Windows Desktop and Windows Universal applications.</p>

<p>The Cinder OpenGL API is designed to abstract as much as possible of the low-level details of OpenGL without sacrificing power, while remaining familiar to users who are already experienced with OpenGL. The API is exposed primarily through the <ci>ci::gl</ci> namespace, and interoperates with the other portions of Cinder at various points we'll explore later.</p>

<p>This guide will offer a tour of Cinder's OpenGL functionality, with two caveats. First, inevitably users have widely varying levels of experience with something like OpenGL, so targeting a specific level is nearly impossible. Advanced users are asked to forgive information which will likely seem too basic in places. Second, this guide is not meant to be a substitute for learning the wider craft of graphics programming. Please refer to resources listed in the <a href="further_reading.html">Further Reading</a> section to continue learning.<p>
