      <h1>Web Workers</h1>

      <p>Web workers can essentially be thought of as the threads of the web. That being said though there are some limitations to what you can do in a Web Worker.</p>

      <ul><li>You cannot pass complex types to a thread, only standard Javascript types. When it comes to C++, you can only pass a <code>char*</code> and a <code>void*</code></li><li>You will not have access to the DOM.</li></ul>

      <p>That being said ,  there are 2 ways of writing web workers.</p>

      <h2>As a Cpp program</h2>

	  <p>You can write Web Workers as a C++ program. Unfortuantely you will have to treat it essentially as a separate project as in order to build a worker, 
		  you will need to add the flag <code>-s BUILD_AS_WORKER=1</code>
		 Note that you will also have to add another flag separately called <code>EXPORTED_FUNCTIONS</code> in which you make it equal to an array like object with all the method names in your worker file that you want to expose prefixed with underscores, IE : <code>[&#39;_onmessage&#39;]</code></p>

      <p>It currently appears you can add as many functions as you&#39;d like and use your libraries the same way you might a regular project.</p>
			<p>You could conceptually write the setup for this in the same CMake file as your main application but it is advised to seperate your worker into a new project for clarity.</p>

      <h2>As Javascript</h2>

	  <p>The potentially easier alternative might be to write your worker directly as JS. The CINDER_HELPERS namespace contains a function called <code>sourceToBlob</code>
		which will convert any string source into a format suitable for instantiating a WebWorker in Javascript. 

		Note that going this route and trying to use C++ to talk to the worker is a bit of a pain as you'll have to use the rather verbose emscripten::val api or proxy a global Javascript function 
		but it is possible to go this route if you'd like. 
		</p>
	 
	  <h2>Offscreen canvas</h2>
	  <p>Something interesting that Emscripten supports is the ability to use OffscreenCanvas.
	  Currently - only Firefox has good support for OffscreenCanvas but it has been rumored that Chrome is set to get better support in the next version</p>
