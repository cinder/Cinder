			<h1><a id="Faq_0"></a>Faq</h1>
			<p>While building projects targeting WebAssembly, you can potentially run into some issues.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>My application works in one browser but not in another.</b>
					<br/>
						Despite the fact that there is technically a standard for how everything works, 
						browser builders have thus far decided to implement things differently or roll things out
						on different timelines. For example, Apple's Safari STILL does not support WebGL 2.
						Chrome and Firefox are the recommended browsers though you may have luck with other ones.
					
				</li>

				<br/>
				<li>
					<b>I can't load files hosted on another server.</b>
					<br/>
						Browsers operate on the principle that all content loaded must be on the same server as the page you're 
						requesting. The process of making a request for content on another server is called a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS" target="_blank">Cross-Origin Request Sharing</a>, 
						or CORS for short.


						<br/>
						<br/>
						CORS is not enabled by default. If you must load content from another server, it is possible to get around this restriction by enabling CORS handling on your server which is 
						a pretty basic option these days on common open-source server software. If you don't have access to the server, then you'll have to contact someone that does. 
					
				</li>

				<br/>
				<li>
					<b>How do I deploy my project?</b>
					<br/>
						Assuming you're using <code>ci_emscripten_app</code>, Cinder Emscripten is set up so that when you build, depending on your build type (the default is "Debug"), you'll have either a 
						"Debug" or "Release" folder inside of your build directory. You should be able to just copy and drop the contents of this folder 
						onto your server.

						<br/>
						<br/>
						If you're writing your own CMakeLists file - well then, that's up to you to figure out but in general, your output should come out in the build area that you specify. 
					
				</li>
