      <h1>Things to remember when deploying to the web</h1>
      <p>The web is ultimately a different world altogether compared to the world of desktop and mobile development. There are some special things to take care to remember when dealing with Cinder Emscripten.</p>

      <h2>Output file size and how to serve smaller files over the web.</h2>

      <p>The output of WebAssembly files is generally quite large. It&#39;s probably not going to be a big deal if you&#39;re just doing an installation but if you intend to distribute your project to the world, it could be worth thinking about.</p>

	  <p>The most common way of reducing the file size of your output is to ensure that you build your WebAssembly bundle with optimizations, which can be included by adding <code>-s WASM=1 -Os -g0</code> flags to your project&#39;s CMake file.
		(if you're using ci_emscripten_app, this will happen automatically when building in Release mode) </p>

      <p><a target="_blank" href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/01/shrinking-webassembly-and-javascript-code-sizes-in-emscripten/">See here for more information</a></p>

      <h2>Re: External media that&#39;s not on the URL / server you&#39;re deploying on</h2>

      <p>Note that due to how browsers work, with the exception of some built-in elements like the image tag,  by default, you cannot grab assets directly from another server different from the one you&#39;re deploying on. This is known as a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS">Cross Origin Resource Sharing</a> and it is normally not allowed.</p>

      <p>If for some reason you must absolutely store your content on another server, you&#39;ll need to ensure that that server is set up to accept CORS requests, only then will you be able to pull content from elsewhere. It should not be difficult to do and most common place server 
		  software packages usually include a simple way of enabling this feature.</p>

      <h2>Dealing With video</h2>

	  <p>There is a special object called <code>EmscriptenVideo</code> that is availble whose sole purpose 
		is to playback video. While there are other techniques to stream video data, 
		using EmscriptenVideo is the easiset way as it just takes advantage of the browser's built-in 
		video tag. It even provides a texture you can use!</p>

      <h2>Multi-window projects</h2>

      <p>Note that you likely won&#39;t be able to port over any multi-window projects. On the web, each <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element&#39;s WebGL context, and all of the content that it creates, is only available to that context&#39;s canvas element. </p>

			<h2> Dealing with audio</h2>
			<p>Note that as of Chrome 69 - you may experience issues in doing anything with audio, specifically, the tab may in fact crash before anything is loaded. Oddly enough there isn't any issue as long as
				you have the dev tools open. Firefox is known to be fine for audio so it may be worthwhile to just stick to that. </p>
