        <section id="install">
            <h1><a id="Getting_things_set_up_0"></a>Getting things set up</h1>
            <p>There are number of things you'll need to do in order to get things set up to build with Emscripten. If you're already familiar with CMake projects and how those work, then this will likely not be new for you as the process for running an Emscripten project is nearly identical.</p>
            <h1><a id="System_requirements_3"></a>System requirements</h1>
            <p>In terms of hardware requirements, this should work on any system that supports Cinder and Emscripten.</p>

            <h1><a id="Browser_support_43"></a>Browser support</h1>
            <p>Browser support can be a little tricker. You technically just need a browser that can support WebGL 2 but even if there is support, sometimes different browser developers enable/disable different things. That being said the recommended browsers are Firefox or Chrome.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>When running your application</strong><br>
                To run your Cinder applications, while not strictly necessary, it's recommended to host on a server that can serve files with the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types">mime type</a> <code>application/wasm</code>
            </p>
            <p>If your server does not support that mime type, you will still be able to run your app, but may suffer from a performance decrease as the 
                asm.js binary will load in place of the WebAssembly. Asm.js is known to not be quite as optimized as WebAssembly.</p>

            
            <h1><a id="Downloading_the_essentials_6"></a>Downloading the essentials</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>Install <a target="_blank" href="https://cmake.org/">Cmake</a> (at least version 3.10 but may work on older versions as well)</li>
                <li>
                    You'll also need a *nix style terminal window as well as <code>make</code> or something similar if you happen to be on Windows
                    <ul>
                        <li>For *nix systems, bash will do just fine. If you're on Windows, the easiest shell to get would be the one that comes with a standard <code>git</code> installation. If you'd like an alternative, the Windows Subsystem for Linux will work as well.</li>
                        <li>If you're using a *nix based computer, you should have the command <code>make</code> available to you. If you're on Windows, this was tested on MingGW 64. If you're using the Windows Linux subsystem, you will have the <code>make</code> command available.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Of course, you'll need to install Emscripten. <a target="_blank" href="http://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/docs/getting_started/downloads.html">Make sure to follow the directions found on the official site</a> as the method of installation has changed since Emscripten was originally conceived.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Once you have all that...</p>
            
            <h1><a id="Building_Cinder_16"></a>Building Cinder</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>First, run <code>emsdk activate latest</code>, then run <code>source emsdk_env.sh</code></li>
                <li>Navigate into  <code>Cinder/emscripten</code> directory and run <code>./cibuild</code></li>
            </ul>
            <h1><a id="If_you_gotta_build_Boost_this_is_optional_21"></a>If you gotta build Boost (this is optional)</h1>
            <p>Emscripten support relies on Boost system and filesystem libraries which should be included. If for some reason you need to rebuild. Note that you will definitely need a Unix-y terminal for this, Git Bash won't work.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Download Boost. Note that it appears that the set of headers used needs to match the version of the library built. The current version of Boost being used is 1.60. When it's downloaded cd into the Boost directory.</li>
                <li>run <a target="_blank" href="http://bootstrap.sh">bootstrap.sh</a>. It should produce 2 executables but we're only interested in one called b2.</li>
                <li>Next you can run b2 --with-system --with-filesystem toolset=emscripten link=static. If for some reason you get an error, you can try replacing emscripten with clang-emscripten</li>
                <li>In your Cinder folder, drop the output in lib/emscripten</li>
            </ul>
            <h1><a id="Updating_your_systems_PATH_variable_28"></a>Updating your systems <code>PATH</code> variable</h1>
            <p>This isn't entirely necessary it will be useful to add the path to your <code>emsdk</code> folder to your system's <code>PATH</code> variable to make it easier to run commands.</p>
            <p><a href="/part2.html">Now we can start on to building an actual projecct.</a></p>
