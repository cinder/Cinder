      <h1><a id="Building_an_Emscripten_project_0"></a>Building an Emscripten project.</h1>
      <p>Building a project that targets Emscripten is a lot like building a project that builds with CMake. That being said, there are some very subtle differences.</p>
	 
	  <h1><a id="Creating_a_project_structure_4"></a>Creating a project structure.</h1>
      <p>You can start off by generating your project with Tinderbox, like you might already be doing. Now if you haven't worked with Cmake before, you'll also have to make some kind of "build" folder, basically a place where your compiled files will get output to; the common practice is to just have a folder called build at the root of your project(note you can name it something other than build if you want)</p>
	  <p>Next, you'll need a CMakeLists.txt file that will describe how to build your project. If you've never worked with CMake before, you can check out any of the samples in <code>samples/_emscripten</code> which will have CMake files available. If you're familiar
		with CMake and want to write everything by hand, grabbing the CMakeLists file that builds Cinder is a good starting point to see what flags and settings need to applied to build for Emscripten. </p>
     <p>Now we can move onto actually building a project. </p>
	 
	  <h1><a id="Building_a_project_16"></a>Building a project</h1>
      <p>To build your project, from within your build folder(note I'm assuming it's within the root of your project)</p>
      <ul>
	  <li>run <code>emcmake cmake ..</code></li>
	  <li>run <code>make</code> (or <code>mingw32-make</code> etc if on Windows)</li>
      <li>When the build is done, everything you need to upload will end up in your build folder. </li>

		
		<li>
			Note that resource and asset bundling/copying is not automatically done because builds will fail if the compiler can't find the 
			resources directory. To add your asseet folders :
			<br/>
			<p><b>For Resources</b></p>
			<p>If you're not using ci_emscripten_app(which will be talked about later on) you can add the flag</p>
			<p><code>--preload-file ../(path to your resources folder)@</code></p>
			
			<p><b>For Assets</b></p>
			<p>If you're not using ci_emscripten_app, unless your CMake file is already set up to copy it over, you will have to manually copy your assets folder into your output directory.</p>
		
			
		</li>
	</ul>

      <h1><a id="Running_your_project_24"></a>Running your project</h1>
	  <p>Running your project is fairly straightforward. You'll need to serve your project from a server somehow, one that can support the mime type <code>application/wasm</code>(though note this kind of server is not strictly necessary but it may provide better performance)</p>
	  <p>There are a multitude of ways to do so, but perhaps the simplist solution is to borrow the built-in server on good ol' Python</p>
		
	  <ul>
		<li>if on Python 2, from within your build directory, run <code>python -m SimpleHTTPServer</code></li>
		<li>if on Python 3, your command is <code>python -m http.server</code></li>
		<li>Note that for both commands you can specify a port after typing in the command, otherwise things will default to port 8000</li>
		<li>Currently, while your project should still run, it won't technically be running in it's WebAssembly form since the python server does not support WebAssembly at the moment.
			There is a provided alternative server you can use called <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/wasm-server" target="_blanke">wasm-server</a>. You can of course choose to roll your own as well if you wish. 
		</li>
	 </ul>
	
	<h1><a id="Building_the_samples_24"></a>Building the samples</h1>
      <p> If you'd like to generate Cmake project folder for the the samples, there is a helper python script in
		   <code>Cinder/emscripten/sample_generation</code> called <code>gensamples.py</code>. 
		   It will also generate a sample CMakeLists.txt file for each sample as well. 
		   Note that while the script attempts to avoid generating things in projects where there is known incompatibility with Emscripten, 
		   there is no guarantee that all the samples will run against Emscripten.</p>
  
	  <h1><a id="ci_emscripten_app"></a>ci_emscripten_app</h1>
      <p>If you're not comfortable writing your own CMakeLists.txt file, there is helper function to make things a 
		  little bit easier. If you run <code>gensamples.py</code> and then check the samples, 
		  you can see how to use the function. Also see the <a href="/part9.html">ci_emscripten_app section</a> for a more in-depth look as to the options and other functionality
		it can provide. </p>
	  <p>If you've been using <code>ci_make_app</code>, the functionality and usage is very similar. 
		Check out <code>/proj/cmake/cinderEmscriptenApp.cmake</code> to see what the function looks like. All options have comments describing what they are for. </p>
