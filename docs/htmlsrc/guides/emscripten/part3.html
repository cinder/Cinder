      <h1>Potential issues</h1>
      <p> While things do basically appear to be working, there are some things that could potentially break things depending on what you're doing</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Including Freetype's ftlcdfil.c file will cause a link error when building Cinder which states `ERROR: Linking globals named 'ft_lcd_padding': symbol multiply defined!`</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Shaders are currently not detached after creation due to a possible bug Emscripten that essentially sets the shader handle to null.
          </p>
        </li>
      
        <li>
		  <p> Due to changes in the WebAudio ecosystem and the preference of the web world for using the <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/12/audio-worklet" target="_blank">AudioWorklet api</a>, there is currently no built-in audio support as the 
			AudioWorklet api relies heavily on writing Javascript which does make it more difficult to fully integrate. Please see part 6 for more information.
		</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
			<p> When doing TransformFeedback, you have to remember to unbind your transform feedback buffers. It is unclear as to why this is a requirement but it appears to be an underlying Emscripten issue.</p>
