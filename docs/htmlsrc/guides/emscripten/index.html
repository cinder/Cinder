            <h1><a id="Cinder_Emscripten_Guide_1"></a>Cinder Emscripten Guide</h1>
            <p>Cinder now supports building for Emscripten as of version (todo : add version number ). This allows users to open up their Cinder applications to the world wide web!</p>
		   
			<h1><a id="But_what_is_Emscripten_exactly_5"></a>But what is Emscripten exactly?</h1>
            <p>Emscripten is a toolchain for compiling to asm.js and WebAssembly, built using LLVM, that lets you run C and C++ on the web at near-native speed without plugins.</p>
            <p>In essence, it's simply a tool that lets you treat the web as another compilation target. A large chunk of the work was already done thanks to the efforts of <a href="https://github.com/chaoticbob/Cinder-Emscripten">Hai Nguyen</a> (<a href="https://github.com/chaoticbob">@chaoticbob</a>), this latest version builds on top of that by adding some additional features such as video support.</p>
			
			<h1><a id="How_it_works_10"></a>How it works</h1>
            <p>You can treat your Emscripten project pretty much like any other CMake based Cinder project, you just need to run a slightly different command than what you might be used to.</p>
			
			<h1><a id="Whats_known_to_notwork_13"></a>Whats known to (not)work</h1>
            <p>A large chunk of what you know about Cinder should mostly be transferable directly when building with Emscripten in mind, so with that said, it is perhaps easier to instead list all currently known un-supported features</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Threads (there is some experimentation with adatpting pthread but due to the Spectre vulnerability, support of this does depend a little on browser builders)</li>
                <li>PBOs</li>
                <li>Multi-window support (with some trickery you could perhaps simulate multi-screen support but given the strictness with how things are sandboxed on the web the possibility remains very low.)</li>
				<li>Compute shaders are currently not useable in WebGL</li>
				<li>SSBOs</li>
				<li>It is also currently not possible to bind buffers for use in shaders for uses other than Transform Feedback or UBOs.</li>
			</ul>
            <h1><a id="Demos_22"></a>Demos</h1>
            <p>You can find some of the original demos <a href="http://chaoticbob.github.io/Cinder-Emscripten/">here</a></p>
