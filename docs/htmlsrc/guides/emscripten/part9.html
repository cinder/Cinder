			<h1>ci_emscripten_app</h1>
            <p><code>ci_emscripten_app</code> is a helper function to make your <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> files easier to write. </p>
            <p>It is designed to more or less mimic <code>ci_make_app</code> for desktop apps but with some Emscripten specific parameters</p>
            <p>While you can still hand-write your CMakeLists.txt file, it is recommended to use <code>ci_emscripten_app</code> instead.</p>


            <p><code>ci_emscripten_app</code> takes a number of options. At the very least, you'll need to specify the options: 
                <br/>
                * <code>CINDER_PATH</code>
                <br/>
                * <code>SOURCES</code>(and the path to your main app file)
            </p>
            <p>
                There are a number of other options you can pass in as well. 
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>CINDER_PATH</code> - the path to where you downloaded Cinder. This is important
                    as otherwise your code will not compile correctly. In general a relative path from where your CMakeLists.txt file is 
                    is expected, but it should work with an absolute path as well. 
                </li>

                <br/>
                <li>
                    <code>SOURCES</code> - specify a path to all of your .cpp files. Your main app file should be the first item in the list. 
                    Multiple paths should be seperated by spaces and un-quoted. 
                </li>


                <br/>
                <li>

                    <code>INCLUDES</code> - specify a path to all of your .h files here. Formatting should be same as source files. 
                </li>

                <br/>
                <li>
                    <code>LIBRARIES</code> - specify a path to all of your library files here. Formatting for different paths is the same as your source code. Note that Emscripten only supports .a or .bc library files.
                </li>

                <br/>
                <li>
                    <code>FLAGS</code> - by default, some common flags will get used to build your application; that being said,
                     Emscripten has a number of other flags in addition to the ones you can manipulate with ci_emscripten_app that can be used to build 
                    your project. Specify any other flags you want to use as a single string with this parameter. <a href="https://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/docs/tools_reference/emcc.html" target="_blank">See here for more details.</a>
                </li>

                <br/>
                <li>
                    <code>ASSETS</code> - the path to your assets directory if you have one. When your code is built, this 
                    directory will get copied to your build directory. Note that if the NO_ASYNC parameter is specified you will have to rely on the loadAssetAsync function 
                    or write your own function in order to access items in the assets folder. 
                </li>

                <br/>
                <li>
                    <code>RESOURCES</code> - the path to your resources directory if you have one. When your application is built, 
                    all of the files in the resources folder will get bundled into a binary file called "index.binary". Note that
                    if specified, you need to make sure that the folder really does exist or your build will fail. ci_emscripten_app guards against
                    this by only adding the necessary flags if the parameter is set. Also note that if NO_ASYNC is set - you will loose access to the bundle. 
                </li>

                <br/>
                <li>
                    <code>THREADS</code> - enables threading support (via pthread) for your application. Note that due to the Spectre vulnerability, your browser will likely have disabled the <code>SharedArrayBuffer</code> object 
                    which is necessary for this to function correctly. If you're using Chrome, you do have the option of re-enabling support for SharedArrayBuffers which can be done from <a href="chrome://flags" target="_blank">chrome://flags</a>.
                    It's currently unknkown if other browser's will allow support down the line. 
                    If you're interested in learning more about threads with Emscripten, <a href="https://youtu.be/zgOGZgAPUjQ?t=892" target="_blank">Google recently put out a good introduction on the topic.</a>
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    As far as deployment when building a threaded application, Chrome appears to be the only browser offering support.<a href="https://youtu.be/zgOGZgAPUjQ?t=1153" target="_blank">The presenter in the video above talks a little bit about it here.</a>
                </li>
                
                <br/>
                <li>
                    <code>THREAD_POOL_SIZE</code> - this tells the compiler how many threads you definetly plan on using in your application. It's better to specify 
                    this value ahead of time so things can be pre-alocated ahead of time, though it is possible to dynamically generate new threads as well.
                </li>
                
                <br/>
                <li>
                    <code>HTML_TEMPLATE</code> - by default, a there is a default template has a lot of branding already associated with it. 
                    You do have the option to use your own template though by specifiying a path to your template with this paramter. 
                    <a href="https://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/docs/tools_reference/emcc.html#emcc-shell-file" target="_blank">See here for how to specify your own template.</a>
                </li>

                <br/>
                <li>
                    <code>BUILD_TYPE</code> - specify the type of build you would like to do, either "Debug" (which is the default) or "Release".
                    The difference between the two is that in "Release", optimizations are done to help things run better. If you pass in another value, your build will default to "Debug"
                </li>

                <br/>
                <li>
                    <code>BUILD_AS_WORKER</code> - this will build your code as a Web Worker, which is slightly different than a regular application bundle. 
                </li>

                <br/>
                <li>
                    <code>EXPORT_FROM_WORKER</code> - This tells Emscripten what functions you want to expose to your main application within your worker. 
                     The parameter should be a single quoted string with all functions separated by a comma ie  '_onmessage,_postmessage'
                </li>
                <br/>
                <li>
                    <code>NO_ASYNC</code> - by default, some Emscripten libraries are included that deal with http requests among other things. 
                    This is necessary because of the lack of a filesystem api on the web(well, technically it does exist but will be/has been deprecated) and because
                    Cinder Emscripten attempts to emulate <code>ci::app::loadAsset</code> as closely as possible. 
                    
                    In addition, another reason for including Emscripten's async libraries is to 
                    make it possible to load larger files like videos, audio, etc; currently, while you can bundle them into the emulated filesystem(which can be accessed using <code>ci::app::loadResource</code>), 
                    it seems that at the moment, there is an issue with Emscripten and how it will read those larger files. Also, including those larger files will add to your page load time. 
               
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    The tradeoff for including these libraries though is that it will roughly double your compile time(based on early estimates on an i7 7700) and increase your final wasm size(which could be important depending on your project).
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                        If you feel comfortable with asynchronous functions, you can disable inclusion of these libraries by 
                        passing <code>TRUE</code> to the <code>NO_ASYNC</code> parameter. Note that this of course will disable <code>ci::app::loadAsset</code>.
                        In <code>CinderEmscripten.h</code>, there is the function <code>ci::app::loadAssetAsync</code>. It works just like the normal <code>loadAsset</code> function with 
                        2 exceptions. 

                        <ul>
                            <li>There is no return value so you don't pass it into another function(ie loadImage, etc)</li>
                            <li>You need to pass it a lamda as a second parameter that has a ci::DataSourceRef as the parameter for the function.</li>
                        </ul>

                        If you know a little Javascript, you can write your own async request handler as well. 
               

                </li>

                <br/>
                <li>
                    <code>OUTPUT_NAME</code> - By default, the name "index" is used as the output name as it makes it simpler when deploying projects. 
                    If you'd like to specify something specific, this parameter will allow you to do so. 
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    <code>OUTPUT_DIRECTORY</code> - By default, all output should go into your build folder, but if there is another 
                    folder you wish to deploy to, you can specify that path here. 
                </li>

                <li>
                    <code>PRE_JS</code> - Pass in paths to any javascript files you want to include in your build. The JS will get included before your 
                    your main compiled code. 
                </li>

                <li>
                    <code>POST_JS</code> - Pass in paths to any javascript files you want to include in your build. The JS will get included after your 
                    your main compiled code. 
                </li>
