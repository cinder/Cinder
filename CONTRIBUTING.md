# Contributing

We love pull requests. Here's a quick guide.

* [Fork the Cinder repo][fork].
* Clone the repo and checkout the `dev` branch:
```
git clone git@github.com:YOUR-USER-NAME/Cinder.git -b dev
```
* Create a branch for your changes off `dev`:
```
git checkout -b YOUR-BRANCH-NAME
```
* Make your changes and commit them.
* Push to your fork and [submit a pull request][pr].
