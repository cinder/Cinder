	@header CFArray
	CFArray implements an ordered, compact container of pointer-sized
	values. Values are accessed via integer keys (indices), from the
	range 0 to N-1, where N is the number of values in the array when
	an operation is performed. The array is said to be "compact" because
	deleted or inserted values do not leave a gap in the key space --
	the values with higher-numbered indices have their indices
	renumbered lower (or higher, in the case of insertion) so that the
	set of valid indices is always in the integer range [0, N-1]. Thus,
	the index to access a particular value in the array may change over
	time as other values are inserted into or deleted from the array.

	Arrays come in two flavors, immutable, which cannot have values
	added to them or removed from them after the array is created, and
	mutable, to which you can add values or from which remove values.
	Mutable arrays have two subflavors, fixed-capacity, for which there
	is a maximum number set at creation time of values which can be put
	into the array, and variable capacity, which can have an unlimited
	number of values (or rather, limited only by constraints external
	to CFArray, like the amount of available memory). Fixed-capacity
	arrays can be somewhat higher performing, if you can put a definite
	upper limit on the number of values that might be put into the
	array.

	As with all CoreFoundation collection types, arrays maintain hard
	references on the values you put in them, but the retaining and
	releasing functions are user-defined callbacks that can actually do
	whatever the user wants (for example, nothing).

	Computational Complexity
	The access time for a value in the array is guaranteed to be at
	worst O(lg N) for any implementation, current and future, but will
	often be O(1) (constant time). Linear search operations similarly
	have a worst case complexity of O(N*lg N), though typically the
	bounds will be tighter, and so on. Insertion or deletion operations
	will typically be linear in the number of values in the array, but
	may be O(N*lg N) clearly in the worst case in some implementations.
	There are no favored positions within the array for performance;
	that is, it is not necessarily faster to access values with low
	indices, or to insert or delete values with high indices, or
	whatever.

		range location or end point (defined by the location plus
		length minus 1) is outside the index space of the array (0
		to N-1 inclusive, where N is the count of the array), the
		behavior is undefined. If the range length is negative, the
		behavior is undefined. The range may be empty (length 0).
	@param comparator The function with the comparator function type
		signature which is used in the sort operation to compare
		values in the array with the given value. If this parameter
		is not a pointer to a function of the correct prototype, the
		the behavior is undefined. If there are values in the array
		which the comparator function does not expect or cannot
		properly compare, the behavior is undefined. The values in
		the range are sorted from least to greatest according to
		this function.
	@param context A pointer-sized user-defined value, which is passed
		as the third parameter to the comparator function, but is
		otherwise unused by this function. If the context is not
		what is expected by the comparator function, the behavior is
		undefined.
