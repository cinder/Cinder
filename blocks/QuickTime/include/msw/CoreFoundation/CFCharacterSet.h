	@header CFCharacterSet
        CFCharacterSet represents a set, or a bag, of Unicode characters.
        The API consists of 3 groups:
        1) creation/manipulation of CFCharacterSet instances,
        2) query of a single Unicode character membership,
        and 3) bitmap representation related (reading/writing).
        Conceptually, CFCharacterSet is a 136K byte bitmap array of
        which each bit represents a Unicode code point.  It could
        contain the Unicode characters in ISO 10646 Basic Multilingual
        Plane (BMP) and characters in Plane 1 through Plane 16
        accessible via surrogate paris in the Unicode Transformation
        Format, 16-bit encoding form (UTF-16).  In other words, it can
        store values from 0x00000 to 0x10FFFF in the Unicode
        Transformation Format, 32-bit encoding form (UTF-32).  However,
        in general, how CFCharacterSet stores the information is an
        implementation detail.  Note even CFData used for the external
        bitmap representation rarely has 136K byte.  For detailed
        discussion of the external bitmap representation, refer to the
        comments for CFCharacterSetCreateWithBitmapRepresentation below.
        Note that the existance of non-BMP characters in a character set
        does not imply the membership of the corresponding surrogate
        characters.  For example, a character set with U+10000 does not
        match with U+D800.
