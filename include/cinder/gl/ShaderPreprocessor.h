//! \brief Class for parsing and processing GLSL preprocessor directives.
//!
//! Detected files that need to be included, via the `#include` directive, are first searched for relative
//! to the directory of the provided source path (if provided), and then relative to the search directories
//! list. By default, the Platform's default assets path is added to this list, and you can add custom
//! search directories with `addSearchDirectory()`.
//!
//! If a recursive #include is detected, a `ShaderPreprocessorExc` will be thrown.
//!
//! Adding #define statements are also supported, and you can set the #version via `setVersion( int )`. If
//! you are on OpenGL ES, then `" es"` will be appended to the version string.
