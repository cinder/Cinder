//! \brief Interface for performing high-level audio playback tasks.
//!
//! A Voice is an abstraction of something you can hear, and as such they send audio
//! to your computers output device. Currently supports file playback and processing audio with a callback function.
//! Each Voice has controls for setting the volume and pan of its signal, and supports
//! start(), stop(), and pause() functionality.
//!
//! Underneath, playback is managed by a Node, which can be retrieved via the virtual getNode() method to
//! perform more complex tasks.
