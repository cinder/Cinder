Origin and arrangement of Ogg Vobis source code: http://www.xiph.org/downloads/

ogg (version: libogg-1.3.1)
- copied .c's in src folder to oggvorbis/ogg/
- initialized  "ogg_int16_t temp = 0;" on os.h line 97 to silence warning.


vorbis (version: libvorbis-1.3.4)
- copied .[ch]'s from lib folder into oggvorbis/vorbis/
- removed barkmel.c, and tone.c, psytune.c (utility programs)
- added '#pragma warning( disable: 4244 )' to many c files to disable warnings ignored by authors
