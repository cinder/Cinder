/**
 * @brief The master sample rate converter (resampler) class.
 *
 * This class can be considered the "master" sample rate converter (resampler)
 * class since it combines all functionality of this library into a single
 * front-end class to perform sample rate conversion to/from any sample rate,
 * including non-integer sample rates.
 *
 * Note that objects of this class can be constructed on the stack as it has a
 * small member data size. The default template parameters of this class are
 * suited for 27-bit fixed point resampling.
 *
 * Use the CDSPResampler16 class for 16-bit resampling.
 *
 * Use the CDSPResampler24 class for 24-bit resampling (including 32-bit
 * floating point resampling).
 *
 * Use the CDSPResampler16IR class for 16-bit impulse response resampling.
 *
 * @param CInterpClass Interpolator class that should be used by the
 * resampler. The desired interpolation quality can be defined via the
 * template parameters of the interpolator class. See
 * r8b::CDSPFracInterpolator and r8b::CDSPFracDelayFilterBank for description
 * of the template parameters.

public:
	/**
	 * Constructor initalizes the resampler object.
	 *
	 * Note that increasing the transition band and decreasing attenuation
	 * reduces the filter length, this in turn reduces the "input before
	 * output" delay. However, the filter length has only a minor influence on
	 * the overall resampling speed.
	 *
	 * It should be noted that the ReqAtten specifies the minimal difference
	 * between the loudest input signal component and the produced aliasing
	 * artifacts during resampling. For example, if ReqAtten=100 was specified
	 * when performing 2x upsampling, the analysis of the resulting signal may
	 * display high-frequency components which are quieter than the loudest
	 * part of the input signal by only 100 decibel meaning the high-frequency
	 * part did not become "magically" completely silent after resampling. You
	 * have to specify a higher ReqAtten value if you need a totally clean
	 * high-frequency content. On the other hand, it may not be reasonable to
	 * have a high-frequency content cleaner than the input signal itself: if
	 * the input signal is 16-bit, setting ReqAtten to 150 will make its
	 * high-frequency content 24-bit, but the original part of the signal will
	 * remain 16-bit.
	 *
	 * @param SrcSampleRate Source signal sample rate. Both sample rates can
	 * be specified as a ratio, e.g. SrcSampleRate = 1.0, DstSampleRate = 2.0.
	 * @param DstSampleRate Destination signal sample rate. The "power of 2"
	 * ratios between the source and destination sample rates force resampler
	 * to use several fast "power of 2" resampling steps, without using
	 * fractional interpolation at all. Note that the "power of 2" upsampling
	 * (but not downsampling) requires a lot of buffer memory: e.g. upsampling
	 * by a factor of 16 requires an intermediate buffer MaxInLen*(16+8)
	 * samples long. So, when doing the "power of 2" upsampling it is highly
	 * recommended to do it in small steps, e.g. no more than 256 samples at
	 * once (also set the MaxInLen to 256).
	 * @param MaxInLen The maximal planned length of the input buffer (in
	 * samples) that will be passed to the resampler. The resampler relies on
	 * this value as it allocates intermediate buffers. Input buffers longer
	 * than this value should never be supplied to the resampler. Note that
	 * the resampler may use the input buffer itself for intermediate sample
	 * data storage.
	 * @param ReqTransBand Required transition band, in percent of the
	 * spectral space of the input signal (or the output signal if
	 * downsampling is performed) between filter's -3 dB point and the Nyquist
	 * frequency. The range is from CDSPFIRFilter::getLPMinTransBand() to
	 * CDSPFIRFilter::getLPMaxTransBand(), inclusive. When upsampling 88200 or
	 * 96000 audio to a higher sample rates the ReqTransBand can be
	 * considerably increased, up to 30. The selection of ReqTransBand depends
	 * on the level of desire to preserve the high-frequency content. While
	 * values 0.5 to 2 are extremely "greedy" settings, not necessary in most
	 * cases, values 2 to 3 can be used in most cases. Values 3 to 4 are
	 * relaxed settings, but they still offer a flat frequency response up to
	 * 21kHz with 44.1k source or destination sample rate.
	 * @param ReqAtten Required stop-band attenuation in decibel, in the range
	 * CDSPFIRFilter::getLPMinAtten() to CDSPFIRFilter::getLPMaxAtten(),
	 * inclusive. The actual attenuation may be 0.40-4.46 dB higher. The
	 * general formula for selecting the ReqAtten is 6.02 * Bits + 40, where
	 * "Bits" is the bit resolution (e.g. 16, 24), "40" is an added resolution
	 * for stationary signals, this value can be decreased to 20 to 10 if the
	 * signal being resampled is mostly non-stationary (e.g. impulse
	 * response).
	 * @param ReqPhase Required filter's phase response. Note that this
	 * setting does not affect interpolator's phase response which is always
	 * linear-phase. Also note that if the "power of 2" resampling was engaged
	 * by the resampler together with the minimum-phase response, the audio
	 * stream may become fractionally delayed by up to 1 sample, depending on
	 * the minimum-phase filter's actual fractional delay. If the output
	 * stream should always start at "time zero" offset with minimum-phase
	 * filters the UsePower2 should be set to "false". Linear-phase filters
	 * do not have fractional delay.
	 * @param UsePower2 "True" if the "power of 2" resampling optimization
	 * should be used when possible. This value should be set to "false" if
	 * the access to interpolator is needed in any case (also the source and
	 * destination sample rates should not be equal).
	 * @see CDSPFIRFilterCache::getLPFilter()
