 * @brief The "base" inclusion file with basic classes and functions.
 *
 * This is the "base" inclusion file for the "r8brain-free-src" sample rate
 * converter. This inclusion file contains implementations of several small
 * utility classes and functions used by the library.

 *
 * @section intro_sec Introduction
 *
 * Open source (under the MIT license) high-quality professional audio sample
 * rate converter (SRC) (resampling) library. Features routines for SRC, both
 * up- and downsampling, to/from any sample rate, including non-integer sample
 * rates: it can be also used for conversion to/from SACD sample rate and even
 * go beyond that. SRC routines were implemented in multi-platform C++ code,
 * and have a high level of optimality.
 *
 * The structure of this library's objects is such that they can be frequently
 * created and destroyed in large applications with a minimal performance
 * impact due to a high level of reusability of its most
 * "initialization-expensive" objects: the fast Fourier transform and FIR
 * filter objects.
 *
 * The SRC algorithm at first produces 2X oversampled (relative to the source
 * sample rate, or the destination sample rate if the downsampling is
 * performed) signal and then performs interpolation using a bank of short
 * (14 to 28 taps, depending on the required precision)
 * polynomial-interpolated sinc-based fractional delay filters. This puts the
 * algorithm into the league of the fastest among the most precise SRC
 * algorithms. The more precise alternative being only the whole
 * number-factored SRC, which can be slower.
 *
 * @section requirements Requirements
 *
 * C++ compiler and system with the "double" floating point type (53-bit
 * mantissa) support. No explicit code for the "float" type is present in this
 * library, because as practice has shown the "float"-based code performs
 * considerably slower on a modern processor, at least in this library.
 * However, if the "double" type really represents the "float" type (24-bit
 * mantissa) in a given compiler, on a given system, the library won't become
 * broken, only the conversion quality may become degraded. This library
 * always uses the "sizeof( double )" operator to obtain "double" floating
 * point type's size in bytes. This library does not have dependencies beside
 * the standard C library, the "windows.h" on Windows and the "pthread.h" on
 * Mac OS X and Linux.
 *
 * @section usage Usage Information
 *
 * The sample rate converter (resampler) is represented by the
 * r8b::CDSPResampler class, which is a single front-end class for the whole
 * library. You do not basically need to use nor understand any other classes
 * beside this class. Several derived classes that have varying levels of
 * precision are also available.
 *
 * The code of the library resides in the "r8b" C++ namespace, effectively
 * isolating it from all other code. The code is thread-safe. A separate
 * resampler object should be created for each audio channel or stream being
 * processed.
 *
 * Note that you will need to compile the "r8bbase.cpp" source file and
 * include the resulting object file into your application build. This source
 * file includes definitions of several global static objects used by the
 * library. You may also need to include to your project: the "Kernel32"
 * library (on Windows) and the "pthread" library on Mac OS X and Linux.
 *
 * The code of this library was commented in the Doxygen style. To generate
 * the documentation locally you may run the "doxygen ./other/r8bdoxy.txt"
 * command from the library's directory.
 *
 * Preliminary tests show that the r8b::CDSPResampler24 resampler class
 * achieves 15.6*n_cores Mflops when converting 1 channel of audio from 44100
 * to 96000 sample rate, on a typical Intel Core i7-4770K processor-based
 * system without overclocking. This approximately translates to a real-time
 * resampling of 160*n_cores audio streams, at 100% CPU load.
 *
 * @section dll Dynamic Link Library
 *
 * The functions of this SRC library are also accessible in simplified form
 * via the DLL file on Windows, requiring a processor with SSE2 support.
 * Delphi Pascal interface unit file for the DLL file is available. DLL and
 * C LIB files are distributed in a separate ZIP file on the project's home
 * page. On non-Windows systems it is preferrable to use the C++ library
 * directly.
 *
 * @section realtime Real-time Applications
 *
 * The resampler class of this library was designed as asynchronous processor:
 * it may produce any number of output samples, depending on the input sample
 * data length and the resampling parameters. The resampler must be fed with
 * the input sample data until enough output sample data was produced, with
 * any excess output samples used before feeding the resampler with more input
 * data. A "relief" factor here is that the resampler removes the initial
 * processing latency automatically, and that after initial moments of
 * processing the output becomes steady, with only minor output sample data
 * length fluctuations.
 *
 * Note that the r8b::CDSPResampler::getInLenBeforeOutStart() function can be
 * used to estimate the number of input samples that should be provided to the
 * resampler before the actual output starts.
 *
 * @section notes Notes
 *
 * When using the r8b::CDSPResampler<> class directly, you may select the
 * transition band/steepness of the low-pass (reconstruction) filter,
 * expressed as a percentage of the full spectral bandwidth of the input
 * signal (or the output signal if the downsampling is performed), and the
 * desired stop-band attenuation in decibel.
 *
 * The transition band is specified as the normalized spectral space of the
 * input signal (or the output signal if the downsampling is performed)
 * between the low-pass filter's -3 dB point and the Nyquist frequency, and
 * ranges from 0.5% to 45%. Stop-band attenuation can be specified in the
 * range 49 to 218 decibel.
 *
 * This SRC library also implements a faster "power of 2" resampling (e.g. 2X,
 * 4X, 8X, 16X, etc. upsampling and downsampling).
 *
 * This library was tested for compatibility with GNU C++, Microsoft Visual
 * C++ and Intel C++ compilers, on 32- and 64-bit Windows, Mac OS X and CentOS
 * Linux.
 *
 * All code is fully "inline", without the need to compile many source files.
 * The memory footprint is quite modest (8-byte "double" type data):
 *
 *  * 1.2 MB of static memory for the fractional delay filters
 *  * filter memory, per filter (N*8*2 bytes, where N is the block length,
 *    usually in the range 256 to 2048)
 *  * Ooura's FFT algorithm tables, per channel (N*8 bytes), plus 1 to 7
 *    smaller tables (128*8 bytes) for the "power of 2" resampling
 *  * convolver memory, per channel (N*8*5 bytes), plus Z=1 to 7 smaller
 *    convolvers for the "power of 2" resampling (Z*128*8*5 bytes)
 *  * interpolator memory (8 KB per channel)
 *  * I/O buffers, per channel (proportional to the maximal input buffer
 *    length and the source to destination sample rate ratio)
